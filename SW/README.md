# Convolution HW Accelerator Control Part
This code is for FPGA PS to run.  
Main purpose is to control FPGA's PL.   
The code is writtend by C language on Xilix Vitis SW IDE.
After running the code , if the message "[Match] REF_C vs RTL_V" is printed , reference c code and RTL code have the same result.   
But if the message "[Mismatch] result[0] : %d vs result_0_rtl" is printed , reference c code and RTL code have different result.    

### Platform : Vitis 22.1v (Xilinx SW IDE) 
### Language : C  
### Code Version : 1.0

# Conclusion
This SW coding task was a experience to learn how to use the various drivers provided by xilinx.    
The meaning of this experience is how to use libraries created by someone else.   
This task takes time and need to understand code author's intention.    
Why did the author write this code like this? How do I use a function?    
Maybe , I will use code made by others in the field.    
This experience will be a good helper after I have a job.
