# Convolution HW Accelerator Implementation
This part is an attempt to implement a convolution HW accelerator system.  
The code is writtend by Verilog and synthesized on Xilix FPGA using Vivado.  
This code is fully optimized and synthesizable. 

### Platform : Vivado 22.1v (Xilinx HW IDE)  
### Language : Verilog  
### Board : ZYBO Z7-20
### Implement Resource Usage

# Conclusion  
I think that pure RTL hardware design is not good choice for neural networks. So I try to design a part of the neural networks.  
Especially, Convolution is a core computation of neural networks and is a part which takes a lot of times.  
This is a reason why I try to design as hardware. 
I proceeded with all stages of planning, design, verification by myself.  
This special experience was a new challenge for me and I could learn a lot.   
I hope it will be an experience that goes one step further.
